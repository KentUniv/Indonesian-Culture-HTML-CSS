<h2 id="location"><b>Where is Indonesia located?</b></h2>
    <p><b>
        Indonesia which is officially known as the republic of Indonesia is a country 
        in Southeast Asia and Oceania between the Indian and Pacific oceans. It consists 
        of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Sulawesi, Java, and parts of Borneo
        and New Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest island country and the 14th-largest 
        country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles). 
        With about 270 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most populous country 
        and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous island, 
        is home to more than half of the country's population.
    </b>></p>

<h2 id="system"><b>What is Indonesia goverment system?</b></h2>
    <p><b>
        Indonesia is a presidential republic with an elected legislature. It has 34 provinces,
         of which five have special status. The country's capital, Jakarta, is the world's 
         second-most populous urban area. Indonesia shares land borders with Papua New Guinea,
          East Timor, and the eastern part of Malaysia, as well as maritime borders with 
          Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and India (Andaman 
          and Nicobar Islands). Despite its large population and densely populated regions, 
          Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support one of the world's highest levels 
          of biodiversity.

<h2 id="culture"><b>Indonesia Culture</b></h2>
<h3>There's no such thing as an "Indonesia Culture"</h3>
<p><b>
    Before we get into anything further, this is an important disclaimer. "Indonesia" is a 
    singular term that names a particular nation, but there's nothing uniform about its
     culture. There are at least 300 ethnic groups in Indonesia, each with their own set of
      customs and distinctive cultural objects. That doesn't mean there aren't any similarities
       or tendencies between one culture to the other, but when reading this phrase keep in mind 
       the diversity that comes with it. Often what considered as Indonesia's culture is in 
       fact an image of a dominant one or reflects an amalgamation of certain similar cultures.
</b></p>

<h3 id="religion">There are 6 religions in Indonesia</h3><br>
<center><img src="images/buddha.jpg" width="500" height="300"></center>
<p><b>
    Indonesia is notorious with its huge Muslim population; the largest in 
    the world despite being a secular country by law. But Islam is just one of
     six official religions acknowledged in the country. The six religion are "Islam, Protestantism, 
     Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism". In Bali, for instance, the 
     dominant religion is Hinduism, and there are location where there are more 
     Christians than Muslims.
</b></p>

<h3 id="celebrate">Indonesians celebrate everything</h3>
<p><b>
    From a child's first step on the ground to certain months of pregnancy, 
    many cultures in Indonesia has special ceremonies for even the tiniest milestones. 
    Many cultures also make a huge deal out of life events like weddings and funerals, 
    mixing them with mesmerizing traditional customs and celebrations. There are also 
    communal celebrations like a myriad of different ceremonies of harvest or thanksgiving, 
    and special dates associated with legends or history.
</b></p>

<h3 id="food">Indonesians Food ideology</h3><br>
<center><img src="images/indofood.jpg" width="400" height="250"></center>
<p><b>
    The archipelago is rich with herbs and spices, which shape traditional recipes to 
    utilize the abundance of those ingredients. In fact, many Indonesian dishes may come
     out strong to tourists tongues. Recipes do vary from one locality to another, according
      to the main crops in the area. Javanese, for instance, tend to like sweeter meals due 
      to the abundance of cane and palm sugar. But many other locales like Padang, Manado, 
      and Bali, sure do not hold back on their chili and spices.
</b></p>

<p><b>
    Indonesia's cuisine is diverse, reflecting the country's history and geography. It includes various types of rice dishes, noodles, soups, and stews, as well as a wide range of meat, fish, and vegetable dishes. The country's cuisine has been influenced by Indian, Chinese, and European culinary traditions.
</b></p>
        
<h3>My favorite food: Sate Padang</h3><br>
<center><img src="images/satepadang.jpeg" width="300" height="200"></center>
<p><b>
    Sate padang, more commonly referred to as Padang satay is a speciality satay from Minangkabau cuisine, made from beef cut into small cubes with spicy sauce on top. Its main characteristic is the thick yellow sauce made from rice flour mixed with beef and offal broth, turmeric, ginger, garlic, coriander, galangal root, cumin, curry powder and salt. In Medan, many Sate Padang use not only beef but also chicken, goat, lamb and mutton. Also in Medan, fried shallot is served on top of sate padang, and lontong as the side.

<h2 id="tour"><b>My recommendation of Indonesia tour spot to visit</b></h2>
<h3>Beaches of Bali</h3>
<center><img src="images/bali.jpg" width="500" height="300"></center>
<p><b>
    Arguably Indonesia's most popular vacation spot, Bali has a number of cultural landmarks and 
    traditions that make a visit here worthwhile. But, for many people, Bali is about the island's
     beautiful beaches. If a beach vacation is what you're looking for, you may want to head to one 
     of Bali's luxury beach resorts and spend some time soaking up the sun.
    Anyone who travels to Bali is going to have warm sand and blue water on their mind, 
    and the island doesn't disappoint. Kuta is the best known beach, and is great for those who
     like to combine sun, surfing, and socializing. Because of its popularity, you'll find no
      shortage of restaurants and things to do here.
If you're looking for something a little quieter and less crowded, Nusa Dua is still a 
beauty, but draws fewer tourists. Sanur is the place to go for a little more culture,
 as well as great water sports.
</b></p>

<h3>Borobudur</h3>
<center><img src="images/borobudur.jpg" width="500" height="300"></center>
<p><b>
This ancient temple is one of the most famous and culturally significant landmarks in Indonesia. Borobudur was built in 
the 8th century and constructed in the shape of a traditional Buddhist mandala. It is one of the top UNESCO World Heritage
sites, and is considered one of the greatest Buddhist sites in the world.

The massive temple was forgotten for centuries, when it is believed that much of the population 
moved to eastern Java due to volcanic eruptions. But it was rediscovered in the 1800s and, today, is one of the 
main draws in Java.

Visiting at sunrise for a torch-light climb up the temple and for the breathtaking experience of watching 
as the complex is bathed in sunlight. Borobudur lies near Yogyakarta, an old Javanese city known for its rich cultural 
and historical offerings.

<h2 id="media"><b>Media platform mostly used in Indonesia</b></h2>
<h3>Whatsapp and Line</h3>
<center><img src="images/wa&line.jpg" width="500" height="250"></center>
<p><b>
WhatsApp and LINE are popular instant messaging applications in Indonesia. Both applications are highly attractive to Indonesian users. Most Indonesians prefer using these applications to communicate with others rather than sending messages from their smartphones’ mobile networks and paying for wireless carrier charges for text messaging.

There are currently 68.8 million Indonesian users on WhatsApp, and LINE has 90 million users, which is a significant number of Indonesians. The applications are also a means of communication for businesses and their consumers. Whatsapp allows businesses to contact their customers, directly answer their queries, and receive immediate feedback. LINE allows its consumers to create an official account and follow the account to be updated on what businesses are up to. Many Indonesian businesses use LINE and WhatsApp as part of their marketing strategies, and the applications are of great importance to them. 
</b></p>

<b><p>
The only lacking part of this 2 application is that they can not link bank card or use the app to pay for something. Since the use of transfering money or paying with a messaging app is not really a thing in indonesia along with the reason of many variety of bank type due to its variety of culture. 
</b></p>

<h3>Instagram</h3>
<center><img src="images/instagram.jpg" width="300" height="250"></center>
<p><b>
Instagram is a popular social media platform in Indonesia, and it is a photo-sharing platform by nature. However, Instagram, too, has become a social marketplace much like Facebook, but the distinction lies in how it operates. As mobile phones have become better, and the interest in aesthetics and details has become increasingly important, businesses use Instagram marketing to attract their potential customers on Instagram through high-quality images and other graphical elements that are eye-catching and interesting.
</b></p>

<b><p>
81% of Instagram users use the social platform to keep up with businesses they are interested in. Small businesses can therefore use Instagram marketing to easily showcase their products and services on their feed, acting as a quick portfolio for consumers to go through. This serves as a benefit for both small businesses and consumers, as the customer can easily access the brands they want to follow. Small businesses do not generally have the budget for extensive marketing campaigns, and Instagram’s platform provides plenty of opportunities for small businesses to indulge in growing their business.

<h3>Batik Art</h3>
<center><img src="images/batik.jpeg" width="250" height="300"></center>
<p><b>
Batik is both an art and a craft, which is becoming ever more popular and well known among contemporary artists all over the world, as a wonderfully creative medium. The art of decorating cloth using wax and dye, has been practised for centuries in many parts of the world including China, Japan, India, South America and Europe.
</p></b>

<p><b>
In Java, an island in Indonesia, batik is part of an ancient tradition, and some of the finest batik cloth in the world is still made there. The word batik originates from the Javanese word “tik” which means to dot. Batik is usually made on a fabric surface (for instance cotton, silk, linen, rayon or hemp), but batik techniques can also be used on paper, wood, leather and even a ceramic surface.
